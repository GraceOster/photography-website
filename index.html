              This photo was taken at my club swim team's practice for the
              team's developing website. I caught a joyful moment shared between
              my teammates before we began a difficult set.

              This was taken at the top of Spencer's Butte, a 3-mile hike in my
              hometown Eugene, OR. This view is extremely rewarding after the
              challenging hike up, especially at sunrise. This is my favorite
              hike to do with family and friends, as long as we bring a speaker
              to scare off the cougars.

              This was taken in downtown Portland for my cousin, Ellie's, senior
              photo submission. This photo perfectly captures her timid
              personality, style, and beauty.

              This was taken on a walk around the neighborhood with my dog,
              Ruby. She is the sweetest, gentlest girl who loves going on walks
              and getting her picture taken.
